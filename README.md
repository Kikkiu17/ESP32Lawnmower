# ESP32 Lawnmower
## Cheap, fully autonomous lawnmowing robot
The aim of this project is building a fully autonomous lawnmowing robot, cabale of operating with a determined path and not with random directions, like most other robots based on microcontrollers such as Arduino, ESP, etc. This robot also wants to be as cheap as possible, costing over 400â‚¬ less than any other commercial lawnmowing robot and will have a lot of customizable options, as it's built mostly with components that are 3D printable.
